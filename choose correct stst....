Which of the following shows the correct hierarchy of arithmetic operators in C? 

Correct answer: (3) ** , / , * , +, _ 

Explanation: In C, the hierarchy (precedence) of arithmetic operators is: 

. ** (Note: ** is not a C operator, so likely this refers to or simply the precedence starts from / and *) 

/ , *, % (same level) 

So option 3 is the closest correct answer. 

 

(I) In b -- 6.6 / a + 2 * n ; which operation will be performed first? 

Correct answer: (1) 6.6 / a 

Explanation: Division / and multiplication * have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right, so 6. 6 / a is performed first. 

 

(m) Which of the following is allowed in a C Arithmetic instruction? 

Correct answer: (3) ( )
