(o) If a is an integer, a - 5 / 2 

Answer: (3) 2 

(Integer division truncates the decimal.) 

 

 

= 7 / 22 * (3 . 1 4 + 2) * 3 / 5 , evaluates to: Let's calculate: 

• 7/22 ¯- 0.31818 (integer division would be 0 but assuming float if declared properly) 

 

 

 

= 30 * 1000 + 2768 ; evaluates to: 

a = 30000 + 2768 = 32768 

Answer: (1) 32768
